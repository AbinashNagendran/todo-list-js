# todo-list-js
A simple TODO list website made with HTML, CSS, and JS. I really needed to organize my work flow I thought this would be a meaningful project

This todo list is pretty simple, create a item on the left side and see it appear on the list on the right. You can't miss it. The goal of this project was just solidify my knowledge begineer knowledge in JS. I could add more features like dark mode but I want to learn React first and then use component to easily implement dark mode. 

Some parts of the scirpts had band-aid solutions to them which I want to fix and make it more clean. That's one big thing I want to learn is having well structured code that is maintainable and I can easily add new features to.
